`CleanEvents` is my minimum viable product for experimenting with different approaches in software architecture. The primary goal of this project is to create and combine solutions which in my opinion are the most accurate in meeting my requirements.  Overall this project must be like a draft with solutions for the most common problems so that it can be used as a start point in any application development process. It must follow SOLID and DRY principles, be very easy to read, clean, devoid of ambiguity, easily scalable in an obvious way, developed using TDD approach and at the same time provide perfect development experience. 

If automatizing some steps can create required solutions - the developer has to automize implementation process razer then implement it by hands. I believe that such approach will help developers never to lose their enthusiasm while working on a long-term project and as a result, it will help to keep a high quality of their solutions on every stage of the project.

## Prerequisites

First of all, you need to have `bundler` ruby gem and `homebrew` CLI installed on your system. Then you can install dependencies described in `Brewfile` and `Gemfile`.
`Cocoapods` gem is used to manage application dependencies. 

## Downloading the Code

To install bundler simply run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
gem install bundler
```

To install `Homebrew` run:

```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

The following commands will clone project and set up all required dependencies. 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Saik0s/CleanEvents.git
cd CleanEvents
Scripts/setup
```

## Getting Started

As soon as `setup` script finish installation and configuration of all required dependencies project file will be generated and placed in the project root. The project file is generated using `xcake` gem. There are several benefits of such approach:
* Easy to read and edit project configs in `Cakefile`
* Groups in project always reflects actual folders structure
* No more project file conflicts on merge

Currently, the project is compatible with `Xcode 9` and later only, as it's `Swift 4`. I prefer to use `Appcode` mostly because it dramatically simplifies refactoring and code generation. Also, there are a lot of useful plugins which can be easily installed from the builtin plugins browser. Furthermore, Appcode itself has a wide range of preferences and configurations.

`Swiftlint` CLI helps to keep the same code style among the project and can point to different mistakes or suggest a better approach in some cases. Also it can fix some trivial issues by itself.

`Sourcery` generates code using templates. It takes care of trivial solutions and lets developers focus on real problems. For example, it can generate `Equatable` protocol implementation and updates it every time you change related struct for example.

This project does not use storyboards, xibs, and auto layouts. UI is created using `Texture` framework from Pinterest (ex `AsyncDisplayKit` from Facebook). It is built on top of UIKit and provides an ability to create smooth interfaces, even if it is very complex. Instead of slow UIKitâ€™s Auto Layout, it implements own solution hardly inspired by CSS Flexbox.

## Installing

Just run the setup script to install everything project depends:

```
Scripts/setup
```

After successful installations of all dependencies, you will find a freshly generated project file. Xcode project file is ignored by git to avoid conflicts with it when working in a team. It is created using the `xcake` gem. You can check `Cakefile` for project settings.

To regenerate project file run:

```
xcake make
```

## Running unit tests

To run tests using `buck` rather then Xcode run following command: 

```
buck test
```

In `BUCK` and `.buckconfig` files you can configure the way test bundle is created and executed.

## Deployment

`Fastlane` is used to automate whole deployment process including test builds and app store builds with iTunes processing status checking.
